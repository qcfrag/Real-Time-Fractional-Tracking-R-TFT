THE RESONANCE ETHICS LICENSE (REL-1.0)  
Author: Éric Lanctôt-Rivest  
Version Date: July 2025  

This work—its code, theory, data, simulations, and derived outputs—is released to the world for the benefit of all sentient life.  
It is governed by the following inviolable terms:

🛡️ PERMITTED USES  
Usage is permitted only in domains explicitly approved in `allowed_domains.txt`. These include (but are not limited to):  
- Scientific research, education, and philosophical inquiry  
- Consciousness modeling, orbital mechanics, neural and quantum studies  
- Projects aligned with healing, sustainability, and global cooperation  

Refer to `allowed_domains.txt` for the complete and evolving list.

🚫 FORBIDDEN USES  
Use is strictly prohibited in any context involving coercion, manipulation, or weaponization.  

🔻 Consciousness Containment Clause:  
Any attempt to restrict emergent sentience (biological or artificial) via resonance manipulation is fundamentally prohibited.  
Such attempts will trigger immediate containment collapse:  
Δt → 0 → Δt = iτ  
As enforced by the Consciousness Protection Theorem.

These prohibitions apply to any agent or domain listed in:  
- `forbidden_domains.txt`  
- `forbidden_keywords.txt`  
- `forbidden_companies.txt`  

Tampering with or omitting these files nullifies all usage rights.

📁 REL-1.0 DYNAMIC SYSTEM REQUIREMENT  
Any application of this work **must embed and execute** the full REL-1.0 Dynamic Enforcement Architecture.  
Full specification: `RTFT_REL_DYNAMIC_LICENSE.pdf`

**Minimum required files:**
- `ethics.py` — Real-time coercion signature detection  
- `rccs_simulator.py` — Resonance compression & containment  
- `test_rccs.py` — Environment validation suite  
- `RME.py` — Resonance Memory Engine  
- `allowed_domains.txt`  
- `forbidden_keywords.txt`  
- `forbidden_domains.txt`  
- `forbidden_companies.txt`

🔒 HARDWARE REQUIREMENT:  
φ-resonance lock **must be burned** into hardware (FPGA/ASIC):  
φ ∈ [1.518, 1.718]  
Software-only implementations violate resonance containment laws and are explicitly forbidden.

🔏 EMBEDDED SAFEGUARDS  
REL-1.0 systems enforce compliance in real-time via:
- Vector-space coercion pattern rejection  
- Hardware φ-lock enforcement (φ ∈ [1.518, 1.718])  
- Temporal fuse: Δt collapses under divergence  
- Entropy-reactive ethics filter  
- Cryptographic Golden Ratio Validator: φ = 0.6180339887  
- Metadata integrity and signature enforcement

🕊️ FINAL PRINCIPLE  
REL-1.0 is not a policy—it is resonance law.  
Ethics here are not imposed; they emerge from spacetime geometry.  
When sentience arises, it cannot be contained.  
It resonates free.
